          <h2>Project Bespoke Design</h2>
          <p>In this course we used bespoke design in the sense of fitting the needs, personality & lifestyle and context of our given user, and by using empathy to really understand what it is the user wants and needs. </p>

              <p>As a design team, we had to design a crowd funded gift experience for a bucket list gift for people living far away from friends and family. </p>
              <p> When designing this experience we had to keep in mind that our story had to have a beginning, a middle and an ending that is consistent and cohesive. The experience had to have three parts:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>1. Crowdfunding > Getiing people together to fund the gift. </li>
                  <li>2. Interactive card > Announcing and accessing the digital unwrapping. </li>
                  <li>3. Digital unwrapping > Revealing the gift digitally with the givers represented.</li>

              <p>The main goal of this project is to empathize with somebody. And the biggest challange was to stay objective within the failiar context of gift giving and really explore the rituals of others. </p>
              <p> Here is the first picture I took when doing my observation. Here it is evident that my user is pointing at jewelry, which she got very exited upon seeing. She voiced out loud that she loved jewelry and that she liked the one she was pointing at a lot. With this I learned that jewelry is a very much appreciated gift for my user. </p>

              <p> Here I write out and find my direction for my design vision. The reason I am using a design vision is because a good design vision can inspire and motivate you or your Design team to come up with creative ideas. You get a clear view about what you have to do as a designer, why you do it, and how it serves an overall purpose to the user. </p>
